          I pair hands-on engineering with people-centered leadership. Recent
          work includes launching a Staff Advisory Council and ERG succession
          framework for Penn State&apos;s Division of Development & Alumni Relations,
          front-line support for 8,000+ new students, and fault-free moderation
          of executive-education programs. I enjoy building tools and programs
          that scale â€” from analytics MVPs to operational playbooks.
